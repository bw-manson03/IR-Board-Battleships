# BATTLESHIPS
## GROUP_509

By running 'make program' in this directory with a University of Canterbury fun kit v4 plugged into a usb port, the game battleships 
will be uploaded.

Battleships starts by giving instructions to choose your ship positions, with text that can be cleared by pushing the navswitch in. 
This will bring up the first of 3 ships onto the LED matrix, which can be moved by using the navswitch directions. After moving a ship 
to the desired position, press in the navswitch to continue to the next ship.

When all 3 ships have been placed, aim the UC fun kit at your opponent and press the navswitch in to start the game between you and 
your opponent once they have finished.

The turns will then start, with the first person to finish placing their ships starting off by shooting a missile. The missile can be 
moved in the same way as the ships, and pressing the white button at the front of the board will fire the missile at the opponent. 
If the missile coordinates match the coordinates of a part of a ship on the opponent's screen, then that ship is sunk. 

The screens will then swap, with the opponent firing the missile at your ships. This will continue until one player is out of ships, 
in which case the other player wins.

To play the game again, press both white buttons on the board to reset the game to the beginning.
